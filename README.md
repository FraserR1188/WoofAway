# WoofAway

## Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Frameworks with Django

- WoofAway is a full-stack Django web application designed to connect dog owners with verified, dog-friendly accommodation providers. The platform allows users to search, book, and review stays that cater specifically to their pets’ needs. At the same time, hosts can register and list their own dog-welcoming properties, manage bookings, and engage with guest feedback.

- The website offers a secure authentication system, a relational database with CRUD functionality for listings and bookings, and e-commerce integration via Stripe to process payments. With a clear user-focused interface, WoofAway aims to deliver a seamless, pet-conscious travel experience while demonstrating strong full-stack development practices in line with professional web application standards.

- This is my Milestoine Project 4 submission for Code Institutes Diploma in Web Application Development Course.

## Design

### Overview

I want the design of the website to super easy to read and navigate. Simplistic design with smooth edges is what I have in mind. The name "WoofAway" implies what the website wants to achieve. It's clean, friendsly and repsonsive design inspired by Airbnb which is tailored for dog owners and hosts. The fonts which are select show a qurky yet understandable and legible.

### Colour

![Colour Scheme](docs/README/Colour%20palette.png)

### Typography

The fonts which I have picked are the playful Caveat for headings, logos and testimonials and the modern Quicksand font for body text, nav and buttons. Caveat adds a more personal feel and friendly feel and Quicksand is clear and easliy read.

### Imagery

The images which will be present on the website will be the logo for WoofAway and the pictures of the houses on the listings. The host will be able to upload them. A profile picture of the host can aslo be uploaded but not necessary.

### Icons

I used the Font Awesome icons for the social links which are present throughout the website in the footer.
